## About The Project

Obesity is a growing public health challenge in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). People with obesity have a higher risk of being exposed to other diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. Recent data suggest that Indonesia is experiencing a dramatic growth in obesity. As of 2018, a significant number of Indonesians live with overweight or obesity, which can be attributed to the difficulty of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 

One of the problems that people often face is the difficulty of monitoring and improving their overall health, especially in their daily food consumption. Many people find it challenging to keep track of the food they consume and determine what is healthy and what is not. That is why we want to provide an app that can help people monitor and improve their overall health, particularly in their daily food consumption. 

Our app will provide a solution for individuals who are struggling to maintain a healthy diet due to time constraints or lack of knowledge. Users can easily track their daily caloric intake, set health goals, and receive personalized nutrition recommendations based on their unique needs and preferences.
